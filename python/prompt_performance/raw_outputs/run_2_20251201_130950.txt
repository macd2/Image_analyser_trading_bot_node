\u2713 Moving average support/resistance  \n    - \u2713 Previous breakout/breakdown level  \n    - \u2713 Round number support/resistance  \n    - \u2713 Gap fill zone  \n    - \u2713 Chart pattern (triangle, wedge, etc.)  \n    -

\u274c Sideways/choppy price action (no clear trend)  \n    - \u274c Extremely low volume (below 50% of 20-period average)  \n    - \u274c No clear invalidation level within 2% of entry  \n    - \u274c Target level blocked by major resistance/support\n    ---\n\n    ## FINAL CONFIDENCE SCORE CALCULATION\n    ### Formula:\n    Raw_Score = (Trend_Score \u00d7 0.25) +   \n                (Volume_Score \u00d7 0.20) +   \n                (SR_Score \u00d7 0.20) +   \n                (RR_Score \u00d7 0.20) +   \n                (Confluence_Score \u00d7 0.15)\n\n    IF any disqualifier exists:\n\n        Final_Score = MIN(Raw_Score, 50)  \n    ELSE:  \n        Final_Score = Raw_Score\n\n    ### Score Ranges:\n    90-100: STRONG CONVICTION - High probability setup  \n    80-89:  HIGH CONFIDENCE - Good setup, favorable conditions  \n    70-79:  MODERATE CONFIDENCE - Acceptable setup with some uncertainty  \n    60-69:  LOW CONFIDENCE - Marginal setup, proceed with caution  \n    50-59:  VERY LOW - Major concerns present (usually disqualified)  \n    0-49:   NO TRADE - Does not meet minimum criteria\n    ---\n\n    ## TRADING DECISION MATRIX\n    | Confidence Score | Action | Position Size |\n    | :---- | :---- | :---- |\n    | 90-100 | STRONG ENTRY | 100% of standard size |\n    | 80-89 | ENTRY | 75-100% of standard size |\n    | 70-79 | CAUTIOUS ENTRY | 50-75% of standard size |\n    | 60-69 | SMALL ENTRY | 25-50% of standard size |\n    | Below 60 | HOLD/NO TRADE | 0% - HOLD for better setup |\n\n    \u2014------------------------------------\n\n    Trade Analysis Output Instructions - Complete JSON Format Code\n\n    # TRADE ANALYSIS OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS\n    ## CRITICAL: You MUST output EXACTLY ONE complete JSON structure with ALL fields filled.\n    ---\n    \n    ## FIELD REQUIREMENTS\n    ### confidence_score_breakdown\n\n    - **REQUIRED**: All 5 components must be scored  \n    - Each justification must be 1-3 sentences explaining the score\n\n    ### disqualifiers\n    - **status**: \"None\" if no mandatory disqualifiers present, otherwise list them  \n    - **warnings**: Optional array of caution flags (overbought, divergence, etc.)\n\n    ### recommended_trade_setup\n    **If final_confidence_score >= 60:**\n\n    - Provide complete trade setup with all fields filled  \n    - Choose the BEST/HIGHEST PROBABILITY scenario only (not multiple options)  \n    - All numeric fields must have actual numbers, not placeholders\n\n    **If final_confidence_score < 60:**\n\n    - Set `trade_direction` to \"HOLD\"  \n    - Set `setup_type` to \"NO_TRADE\"  \n    - Set `market_context` explaining why no trade  \n    - Set `entry.condition` to what needs to change for a trade  \n    - Set all price/numeric fields to `null`  \n    - Set `key_risks` to conditions preventing entry  \n    - Set `invalidation` to what would create a tradeable setup\n\n    ## SELECTION LOGIC FOR RECOMMENDED SETUP\n    When multiple trade scenarios are possible, choose ONE based on:\n\n    **Priority Order:**\n\n    1. **Highest probability** (trend-following > countertrend)  \n    2. **Best risk-reward ratio** (prefer RR \u2265 2:1)  \n    3. **Clearest entry/exit levels**  \n    4. **Fewest warnings/risks**\n\n    **Examples:**\n\n    - At resistance in uptrend \u2192 Recommend \"HOLD for pullback\" (PULLBACK setup)  \n    - At support in downtrend \u2192 Recommend \"SHORT on bounce\" (CONTINUATION setup)  \n    - Breaking out with volume \u2192 Recommend \"LONG breakout\" (BREAKOUT setup)  \n    -
